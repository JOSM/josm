Supplemental information for JOSM -- the Java OpenStreetMap Editor

=============================================================================
            I. Install & Launch
=============================================================================

Installation notes
------------------
To run JOSM, you need:

* The JOSM .jar file, e.g., josm-tested.jar or josm-latest.jar
* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6, or later.


How to get Java Runtime Environment
-----------------------------------
You need JRE Version 1.6 (also called Java 6), or later.

Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X users should visit http://www.java.com
and download the latest Java executable for their system.

Linux users should visit http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html
There is a Linux binary installer, which you must execute from a console, or
use the mechanism of your distribution's packaging system.


How to launch
-------------
Microsoft Windows users launch by double-clicking on the .jar file.
If this does not work, open a command shell and type
"java -jar josm-latest.jar"  in the directory that holds the file. (Please
replace josm-latest.jar with the name of your .jar file, if you aren't using
the latest version.)

Under Linux, open a shell, go to the file directory and type
"java -jar josm-latest.jar" to launch. If this does not work, try to set
your JAVA_HOME variable to the java executable location (the root location,
not the bin).

MacOS X users just click on the .jar file icon.

How to get the source code
--------------------------
Download it directly from the subversion at
https://josm.openstreetmap.de/svn/trunk. To use the command line subversion
client, type

svn co https://josm.openstreetmap.de/svn/trunk josm

The 'patches' directory
-----------------------
Some libraries that JOSM depends on, are patched for various reasons. The files in the patches directory can be used to roll back these customizations. This is useful in order to

 * inspect the changes
 * update to a newer version of the library but keep the modifications

You can use 'quilt' to manage the patches. E.g. the following command applies all of them:

 $ quilt push -a

Of course, it is also possible to apply the patch files manually one by one.
