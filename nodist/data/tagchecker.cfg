# JOSM TagChecker validator file

# Format:
# Each line specifies a certain error to be reported
# <data type> : messagetype : <key><expression><value>
# Lines starting with a # are considered as comments.
#
# Data type can be:
#  node        - a node point
#  way         - a way
#  relation    - a relation
#  *           - all data types
#
# Message type can be:
# E            - an error
# W            - a warning
# I            - an low priority informational warning
#
# Key and value are expressions describing certain keys and values of these keys.
# Regular expressions are supported. In this case the expressions starts and
# ends with a / sign. If an 'i' is appended, the regular expression is
# case insensitive. For instance, /foo|bar/i
#
# The * sign indicates any string.
# The texts BOOLEAN_TRUE and BOOLEAN_FALSE in the value part indicate a special
# handling for boolean values (yes, true, 0, false, no, ...).
#
# Expression can be:
#  !=          - the key/value combination does not match
#  ==          - the key/value combination does match
#
# To have more complicated expressions, multiple elements can be grouped together
# with an logical and (&&).
#
# The comment at the end of a rule is displayed in validator description
#
# Empty lines and space signs are ignored

# The following could replace unnamed way check. Still at the moment we keep it as it is
#way  : W : junction == roundabout && highway == /motorway|trunk|primary|secondary|tertiary|residential|pedestrian/ && /name|ref|(name:.*)|(.*_name)|(.*_ref)/ != * # Unnamed junction
#way  : W : highway == /motorway|trunk|primary|secondary|tertiary|residential|pedestrian/ && /name|ref|(name:.*)|(.*_name)|(.*_ref)/ != * # Unnamed 

# see #5844, #6760
#way  : W : oneway != BOOLEAN_FALSE && /.*:(backward|forward)/ == *    # oneway combined with *:backward/forward


# all former checks are now located in resources/data/validator/*mapcss :-)
