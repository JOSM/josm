    <p>Contains examples code that is not guaranteed to provide a
      stable API across releases of Commons Compress.</p>

    <p>The majority of this package is concerned with the archival of
    the contents of a directory into a single archive or the expansion
    of an archive's content into a local directory. Example CLI
    programs exist with {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.ArchiveCli}, {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.ExpandCli} and
    {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.ListerCli}. As of
    Commons Compress 1.17 this is the main class of the Commons
    Compress jar, i.e. the class that is run when you start <code>java
    -jar commons-compress.jar</code>.</p>

    <h2>Chains</h2>

    <p>The basic abstraction of the package is the {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.Chain}, a chain of
    {@link org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.ChainStep}s
    that are executed in order for each entry. Entries are supplied by
    a {@link org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.Source}
    and finally consumed by a {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.Sink}. While {@code
    Sink}s are {@code ChainStep}s and must be the final step in a
    {@code Chain}, {@code Source}s are not considered part of the
    {@code Chain}.</p>

    <p>Special {@code ChainStep}s exist for filtering entries with
    {@link org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.Filter} or
    transforming entries {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.Transformer} as
    they pass through the chain.</p>

    <h3>Archival and Expansion</h3>

    <p>A chain that takes files from the local file system and creates
    an archive from that can be set up and run with the help of the
    {@link org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.Archive}
    class. The most common source is {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.DirectoryBasedSource}
    which simply supplies all files contained within the directory
    recursively. The {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.ArchiveSinks} class
    provides factory methods for the many ways that can bes used to
    create archives to write to - all those factory methods end up
    with creating instances of {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.FileToArchiveSink}
    or {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.SevenZOutputFileSink}
    under the covers.</p>

    <p>A chain that takes {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.ArchiveEntry}s from a source
    and passes them to a sink can be set up and run with the help of
    the {@link org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.Expand}
    class. The most common sink will be a {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.DirectorySink}
    which writes the entries to a local directory, but different sinks
    are easy to imagine - and in fact {@code ListerCli} uses {@code
    Expand} and simply provides a sink that just prints out the names
    of the entries. Sources that read from archives can be created via
    the factory methods in {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.ArchiveSources}
    which under the covers will create instances of {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.StreamBasedArchiveEntrySource},
    {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.SevenZArchiveEntrySource}
    or {@link
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.examples.ZipArchiveEntrySource}.</p>
