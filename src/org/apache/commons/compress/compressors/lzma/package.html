    <p>Provides stream classes using the "stand-alone" LZMA
      algorithm.</p>

    <p>The classes in this package are wrappers around stream classes
      provided by the public
      domain <a href="https://tukaani.org/xz/java.html">XZ for Java</a>
      library.</p>

    <p>In general you should prefer the more modern and robust XZ
      format over stand-alone LZMA compression.</p>
