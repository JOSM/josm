/**
 * The RemoteCacheFailoverRunner tries to establish a connection with a failover

 * attempt to replace the failover with the primary remote server.
 * <p>
 * It works by switching out the RemoteCacheNoWait inside the Facade.
 * <p>
 * Client (i.e.) the CompositeCache has reference to a RemoteCacheNoWaitFacade.
 * This facade is created by the RemoteCacheFactory. The factory maintains a set
 * of managers, one for each remote server. Typically, there will only be one
 * manager.

 * If you use multiple remote servers, you may want to set one or more as
 * failovers. If a local cache cannot connect to the primary server, or looses
 * its connection to the primary server, it will attempt to restore that
 * Connection in the background. If failovers are defined, the Failover runner
 * will try to connect to a failover until the primary is restored.
