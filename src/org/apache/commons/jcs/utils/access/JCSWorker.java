/**
 * Utility class to encapsulate doing a piece of work, and caching the results
 * in JCS. Simply construct this class with the region name for the Cache and
 * keep a static reference to it instead of the JCS itself. Then make a new
 * org.apache.commons.jcs.utils.access.AbstractJCSWorkerHelper and implement Object
 * doWork() and do the work in there, returning the object to be cached. Then
 * call .getResult() with the key and the AbstractJCSWorkerHelper to get the
 * result of the work. If the object isn't already in the Cache,
 * AbstractJCSWorkerHelper.doWork() will get called, and the result will be put
 * into the cache. If the object is already in cache, the cached result will be
 * returned instead.
 * <p>
 * As an added bonus, multiple JCSWorkers with the same region, and key won't do
 * the work multiple times: The first JCSWorker to get started will do the work,
 * and all subsequent workers with the same region, group, and key will wait on
 * the first one and use his resulting work instead of doing the work
 * themselves.
 * <p>
 * This is ideal when the work being done is a query to the database where the
 * results may take time to be retrieved.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *      public static JCSWorker cachingWorker = new JCSWorker(&quot;example region&quot;);
 *   		public Object getSomething(Serializable aKey){
 *        JCSWorkerHelper helper = new AbstractJCSWorkerHelper(){
 *          public Object doWork(){
 *            // Do some (DB?) work here which results in a list
 *            // This only happens if the cache dosn't have a item in this region for aKey
 *            // Note this is especially useful with Hibernate, which will cache indiviual
 *            // Objects, but not entire query result sets.
 *            List results = query.list();
 *            // Whatever we return here get's cached with aKey, and future calls to
 *            // getResult() on a CachedWorker with the same region and key will return that instead.
 *            return results;
 *        };
 *        List result = worker.getResult(aKey, helper);
 *      }
 * </pre>
 *
 * This is essentially the same as doing:
 *
 * <pre>
 * JCS jcs = JCS.getInstance( &quot;exampleregion&quot; );
 * List results = (List) jcs.get( aKey );
 * if ( results != null )
 * {
 *     //do the work here
 *     results = query.list();
 *     jcs.put( aKey, results );
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * But has the added benefit of the work-load sharing; under normal
 * circumstances if multiple threads all tried to do the same query at the same
 * time, the same query would happen multiple times on the database, and the
 * resulting object would get put into JCS multiple times.
