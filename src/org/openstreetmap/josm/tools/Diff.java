/** A class to compare vectors of objects.  The result of comparison
    is a list of <code>change</code> objects which form an
    edit script.  The objects compared are traditionally lines
    of text from two files.  Comparison options such as "ignore
    whitespace" are implemented by modifying the <code>equals</code>
    and <code>hashcode</code> methods for the objects compared.
<p>
   The basic algorithm is described in: <br>
   "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations", Eugene Myers,
   Algorithmica Vol. 1 No. 2, 1986, p 251.
<p>
   This class outputs different results from GNU diff 1.15 on some
   inputs.  Our results are actually better (smaller change list, smaller
   total size of changes), but it would be nice to know why.  Perhaps
   there is a memory overwrite bug in GNU diff 1.15.
