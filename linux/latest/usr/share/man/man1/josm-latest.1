.SH NAME
josm \- Java OpenStreetMap Editor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B josm-latest
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B JOSM 
is an editor for OpenStreetMap written in Java 8. 
.PP
.B OpenStreetMap 
is a project aimed squarely at creating and providing free geographic data such as street maps to anyone
who wants them. It allows you to view, edit and use geographical data in a collaborative way from 
anywhere on earth.
The project was started because most maps you think of as free actually have legal or technical 
restrictions on their use, holding back people from using them in creative, productive or unexpected
ways.
